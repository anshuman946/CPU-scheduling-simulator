# CPU-scheduling-simulator

 Developed an interactive web-based tool to simulate and visualize key CPU scheduling algorithms including FCFS, SJF, Round Robin,
 and Priority Scheduling.
 • Enabled user-defined process input and real-time Gantt charts rendering with real-time metrics such as Turnaround Time (TAT),
 Waiting Time (WT), and Response Time (RT).
 • Delivered a clean, responsive UI with intuitive controls to support interactive learning and comparative analysis.
